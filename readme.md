Compilation
---
To compile and load the hex to the UCFK4, use the command 'make program' in the directory of the project with AVR compilation tools installed. The repository should be inside the /assignment/team222/ folder for proper access to drivers during compilation.

To just compile a .hex file, use the command 'make' instead.

Playing the game
----
Position the two Funkits so that the IR receivers and transmitters are aligned.

Each player presses the navswitch to begin the game, and are prompted to rotate and then move their battleships. 
There is one 4-length, and two 3-length battleships to place. The first player to place all three battleships is the first to fire.

Players take turns to choose a target location, and the first player to eliminate all three enemy ships is the winner. You can press the navswitch to play another game.
